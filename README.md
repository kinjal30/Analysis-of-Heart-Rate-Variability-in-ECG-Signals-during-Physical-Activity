# ECG Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for processing and analyzing ECG (Electrocardiogram) data. This project involved the analysis of ECG (Electrocardiogram) data using Python. It included tasks such as importing and visualizing the ECG signal using matplotlib and pandas libraries, identifying R-peaks in the signal to calculate heart periods, and plotting heart rate over time. Additionally, the project utilized techniques like peak detection and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from the ECG data. The final result showcased dynamic changes in heart rate, potentially indicating physical activity. 



Used following dependencies:
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

Code Structure:
main.py: Main script for ECG data analysis.
ECG_hw1.csv: Sample ECG data file.
beat_occurrences.csv: CSV file containing detected beats and corresponding ECG amplitudes.

Results

The analysis provides insights into heart rate variations over time, R-peaks detection, and overall ECG signal characteristics.
