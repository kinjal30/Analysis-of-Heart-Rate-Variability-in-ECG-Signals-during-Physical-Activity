# ECG Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for processing and analyzing ECG (Electrocardiogram) data. The code performs various tasks, including importing ECG data, plotting signals, detecting R-peaks, calculating heart periods, and analyzing heart rate over time.

Used following dependencies:
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

Code Structure:
main.py: Main script for ECG data analysis.
ECG_hw1.csv: Sample ECG data file.
beat_occurrences.csv: CSV file containing detected beats and corresponding ECG amplitudes.

Results
The analysis provides insights into heart rate variations over time, R-peaks detection, and overall ECG signal characteristics.
